Shopify Product Crawler

This module provides functionality to crawl product data from Shopify stores
by leveraging Shopify's JSON API endpoint (adding .json to product URLs)
and parsing HTML for review data when review apps are used.

PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZED VERSION:
- Parallel HTTP requests for JSON and HTML data
- Optimized connection pooling and timeouts
- Concurrent review processing
- Cached regex patterns for better performance

I use it primarily under my eyes to set concealer and prevent creasing, and in my T-zone where I get the oiliest. The results are incredible - my concealer doesn't budge, my foundation stays matte but not flat, and I don't get that awful oil slick look by midday. Even after 12+ hour workdays, my makeup still looks fresh and natural. The fact that it's cruelty-free and vegan is a huge bonus for me as well. I've been using this for 8 months now and have repurchased it 4 times - it's become an absolute essential in my daily routine. For the price, you truly cannot find a better performing setting powder.

The longevity is excellent - my makeup looks fresh for 8-10 hours, which is perfect for my work schedule. It photographs beautifully with no flashback, which is crucial since I'm often in photos for work events. The price point is absolutely unbeatable for this level of quality. However, the loose powder format can be quite messy and wasteful. The sifter doesn't regulate the amount very well, so sometimes way too much product comes out, and other times barely any. I've learned to tap it gently and work with it, but it's not the most user-friendly packaging. Despite this issue, I continue to repurchase because the powder itself performs so well. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable, high-quality setting powder, just be prepared to work with the packaging quirks.

The formula is exceptionally well-milled and applies evenly without disturbing the base makeup underneath. What really impressed me is how it photographs - absolutely zero flashback even under harsh studio lighting and camera flashes. I've used it for everything from bridal makeup to fashion shoots, and it consistently delivers flawless results. My clients always comment on how fresh and natural their makeup looks throughout long shooting days. The translucent shade works beautifully on a wide range of skin tones, from fair to deep, without altering the foundation color.

The translucent formula is very forgiving with my fair skin tone, and I haven't experienced any color changes or oxidation issues. What I appreciate most is how it extends the wear time of my makeup without making it look heavy or obvious that I'm wearing powder. My foundation and concealer stay in place much better, especially around my nose where I tend to get a bit oily throughout the day. The price makes it accessible for someone just starting to build their makeup collection, which is incredibly important when you're trying to figure out what works for your skin. I've watched countless YouTube tutorials and this powder always gets mentioned as a great affordable option, so I decided to try it based on those recommendations. I'm so glad I did!
