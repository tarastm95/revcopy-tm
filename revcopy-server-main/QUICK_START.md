# üöÄ RevCopy Enterprise Deployment - Quick Start Guide

This guide will help you deploy RevCopy to your production server with enterprise-grade infrastructure.

## üìã Prerequisites

### Local Machine Requirements
- Python 3.11+
- SSH client
- Git
- Make (GNU Make)

### Server Requirements  
- Ubuntu 20.04+ or Debian 11+ (recommended)
- 4GB+ RAM
- 20GB+ storage
- Root SSH access
- Public IP address

## üéØ One-Command Complete Setup

For the fastest deployment, run this single command:

```bash
make full-setup SERVER_HOST=37.27.217.240
```

This will:
- Install all CLI dependencies
- Setup the remote server with all required software
- Deploy the complete RevCopy stack
- Configure SSL certificates
- Setup monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana)
- Configure webhook handler for GitOps

## üìö Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Clone and Prepare Infrastructure

```bash
# Clone the server infrastructure
git clone https://github.com/Revcopy/revcopy-server.git
cd revcopy-server

# Install CLI dependencies
make install-cli
```

### 2. Setup Remote Server

```bash
# Setup the server (installs Docker, Nginx, security, etc.)
make server-setup SERVER_HOST=37.27.217.240
```

This installs:
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Nginx with reverse proxy
- Python 3.11 & Node.js 18
- UFW firewall with proper rules
- Fail2ban for SSH protection
- SSL tools (Certbot)
- Monitoring tools

### 3. Deploy Application

```bash
# Full deployment with SSL and monitoring
make deploy-remote SERVER_HOST=37.27.217.240
```

### 4. Setup GitOps (Optional)

```bash
# Setup webhook handler for automatic deployments
make setup-webhook SERVER_HOST=37.27.217.240
```

Then configure GitHub webhooks pointing to: `http://37.27.217.240:8080/webhook`

## üåê Access Your Application

After deployment, your applications will be available at:

- **Frontend**: https://37.27.217.240/
- **Admin Panel**: https://37.27.217.240/admin
- **Backend API**: https://37.27.217.240/api
- **Crawler API**: https://37.27.217.240/crawler
- **Prometheus**: http://37.27.217.240:9090
- **Grafana**: http://37.27.217.240:3000

```

### Troubleshooting
```bash
make troubleshoot SERVER_HOST=37.27.217.240
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

The deployment creates a production environment file at `/opt/revcopy/revcopy-server/.env.production`.

Key variables to configure:
- Database credentials (auto-generated)
- API keys (DeepSeek, SMTP)
- Domain names
- Security settings

### SSL Configuration

SSL certificates are automatically obtained via Let's Encrypt. To configure for your domain:

1. Point your domain to the server IP
2. Update the environment file with your domain
3. Re-run deployment

## üîí Security Features

The deployment includes enterprise-grade security:

- **Firewall**: UFW with restrictive rules
- **SSH Protection**: Fail2ban with automatic IP blocking
- **SSL/TLS**: Let's Encrypt certificates with auto-renewal
- **Container Security**: Non-root users, network isolation
- **Secrets Management**: Encrypted secrets with rotation
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive HTTP security headers

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

### Monitoring Stack
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and alerting
- **Grafana**: Visualization dashboards
- **Node Exporter**: System metrics
- **Container Metrics**: Docker container monitoring

### Log Management
- Centralized logging with log rotation
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance monitoring
- Security event logging

## üîÑ GitOps & CI/CD

### GitHub Actions Workflow

The repository includes a professional GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
# Located at .github/workflows/deploy-production.yml
# Triggered on push to main branch or manual dispatch
```

Required GitHub Secrets:
- `SERVER_SSH_KEY`: Your SSH private key
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK`: Slack webhook URL (optional)

### Webhook Handler

Automatic deployments on Git push:
- Repository-specific deployment strategies
- Signature verification for security
- Slack notifications on deployment status
- Health checks after deployment

## üÜò Emergency Procedures

### Emergency Deployment
```bash
make emergency-deploy SERVER_HOST=37.27.217.240
```

### Disaster Recovery
```bash
make disaster-recovery SERVER_HOST=37.27.217.240
```

### Emergency Stop
```bash
# SSH into server
ssh root@37.27.217.240
cd /opt/revcopy/revcopy-server
